# hello-world-2.0
Second round in tutorial


Hello. I always like doing these random little blurbs about myself becaues I get a chance to reflect a bit about who I think I am, as well as spend a little time thinging about things that make me happy, like my dog, Pepper. Much of the time I end up writing about her because she is so cute and I love her so much. It is just so easy to do. Anyway, I think that this is sufficient text. Tootles!
